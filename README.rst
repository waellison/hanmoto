*WillPress* is a modern blog engine for the ancient Web.  It is designed
to present content in a way suitable for any template but also to expose
a REST API that can be consumed by clients for legacy devices on any
operating system capable of using TCP/IP and with any language capable
of sending HTTP requests over the network.

WillPress is going to use Markdown as its input language for markup and
Haml (through ``hamlpy3``) for templates.  The choice of a frontend
library is up to you; I am going to use my own templates, a few
JavaScript files here and there, and my CSS library called *The Chain*.
